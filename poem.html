    <h2>My Poem</h2>
    <pre class="poem">
I saw the people smile,
And at last, the dying smile.
Hearing the last call,
Losing my vision of love.

I felt like I was falling down,
Deep under the waterâ€™s ground.
The dark made me sad,
I saw... I saw nobody there.

The promise that they made,
Now felt like it was in vain.
If I get a chance,
I would try to see the wonders.
